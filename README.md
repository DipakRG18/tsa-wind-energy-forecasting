<h1><u><b>TIME SERIES ANALYSIS : WIND POWER FORECASTING</b></u></h1>
<p>Performed comprehensive data analysis and preprocessing on the Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2012 wind forecasting dataset, addressing missing values, outliers, and ensuring data consistency to establish a solid foundation for accurate model development.<p>
<p>Developed and optimized machine learning models using advanced techniques such as CatBoostRegressor and LightGBM, employing GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning to maximize performance. <p>
 <p> Additionally, implemented an ARIMA model to forecast future trends.
These models achieved notable accuracy, with RMSE scores of 0.17108 for CatBoostRegressor and 0.1809 for LightGBM, demonstrating their effectiveness in wind forecasting.</p>
<p>THANK YOU</p>
